**Beautiful Soup:** Ideal for parsing HTML and XML documents, making it very useful for simple web scraping tasks. It's user-friendly for beginners and can handle various parsers to navigate and search through the parsed data easily.

**Scrapy:** An open-source and collaborative web crawling framework for Python. It's designed for scraping web sites and extracting structured data. Scrapy is more powerful than Beautiful Soup for large-scale web scraping and crawling projects, offering a full-fledged framework that includes features like spider contracts, item pipelines, and a shell for testing.

**Selenium:** Primarily used for automating web applications for testing purposes, but it's also quite powerful for web scraping tasks that require interaction with JavaScript or dealing with websites that implement heavy JavaScript to render their content. Selenium can automate a web browser, allowing you to mimic human browsing behavior effectively.
